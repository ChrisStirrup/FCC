These are the FCC projects for Data Analysis.
In these projects I am given a brief and have to work out how to solve it myself.

Mean Var Std Dev Calc

  In this project I have created a function that accepts a list of 9 numbers and coverts it into a 3x3 numpy array.
  It then returns the mean, varience, Standard Variation, Maximum, Minimum, and Sum of each axis and the flattened matrix.
